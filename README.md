# CiscoPacketTracer-8.2.2

This is a basic shell script to install Cisco Packet Tracer for Fedora.
Due to the lack of a rpm package for this software, we will have to install the .deb file, extract archive and put extracted folders to / directories
manually or is it?

Well this script handles it for you. It installs the deb file, extracts archives and copies extracted folders to respective / directories automatically.

You can check the script before running it to find out what is happening or even better use it as reference and type the commands yourself!

## How to run it?
run the following command: <b>chmod +x ciscopackettracer-installer-fedora</b> <br>
and then run the command: <b>./ciscopackettracer-installer-fedora</b> <br>
to open the software run the command: <b>packettracer</b>
<i>Happy Installation! ðŸ˜ƒ</i>
